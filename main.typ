== Bushing Selection and Design Rationale

=== Overview
To suppport both ends of the two shafts in the reduction stage, two sets of Dry-Running Nylon Sleeve bushings were chosen for their minimal wear properties, low cost, and light weight.

==== Key Selection Requirements
- The bushings must have minimal wear to maintain the accuracy of the speed of the rotation 
- The bushings must have minimal maintenance and lubrication requirements for the convience of the hobbiysts
- Minimize length to keep overall reduction stage small


Bushings were selected instead of bearings because of the small loads required, keeping costs low and occupying minimal space. In particular,
dry bushings were selected to minimize maintenance on the StarTracker and eliminating lubrication requirements
to make construction convienient for hobbiysts.

To support the axial load of the worm gear, so a flanged bushing is used. The low speed of the shafts allow the 
shoulder of the shafts to directly transfer axial load into the bushing flange with minimal wear. Nylon is perfect for this
because of its low friction and minimal wearing properties.

Price was also another important consideration, which the Nylon bushings meet, with a unit price of \$4.59.

In total this is why I selected Dry-Running Nylon Sleeve bushings.
